"""This is a test suit used for testing the code in the library file
birthday.py.

A class that derives from unittest.TestCase has been defined
and it represents a test suit.

Each method in the class whose name starts with test is a test case.

So in this test suit we have:

- a test for lower case names;

- a test for too long names;

- a test for checking if the name is present in the birthday dictionary
contained in the birthday.py module;

- a test for returning just the surname of the full name given.



A setUp function has been created for testing whether the input name is a
digit or not,

which is run before each test. And a tearDown to clean up everything.



The if __name__ == '__main__' has been to say: if this file is directly run by
python or being imported,

run unittest.main().
